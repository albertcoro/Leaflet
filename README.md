<h3>What is this project?</h3>

This project is a playground designed for testing the Leaflet library, an open-source JavaScript library used for creating interactive maps.
It provides a space to experiment with Leaflet's features and functionalities, such as adding markers, polygons, popups, and more.

<h3>What the motivation behind id?</h3>

In my learning process in this new company, I was encouraged to follow a course on Leaflet. After finishing it, I decided to explore a bit further.
This is the final product, it is a bit of a mess. But as said it's a testing playground.

<h3>Conclusions</h3>

I have learned a lot about the Leaflet library both from the course and from my own experimentation in this small side project.
